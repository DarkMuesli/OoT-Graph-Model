# Sub-project for graph composition

This sub-project mainly consists of Jupyter Notebooks to display graphs generated by the functions in oot-graph-builder.py.

The generated graphs contain actors aggregated to complete sub-graphs on a per room basis, connected by transition actors.
Scene setups are generated individually.
Different setups are not yet connected computationally.
Existing connections are hardcoded.
See the Notebook files for examples on how to use oot-graph-builder.py.

## On Copying Graphs

One caveat regarding the code is to be pointed out.
Graphs are copied at various points in the code.
This is done to prevent an existing graph from changing in-place
e.g. when adding warp edges to it, so the respective functions return a new graph to work with.
This is a deliberate code design decision.
However, note that these copies are shallow, i.e. compound objects,
such as lists and dicts, are copied by reference into the new graph.
That means that any manipulation of such a compound object in the new graph object
also projects to the old object and vice versa.
This is not a problem when working on a graph by creating or removing edges,
as the regarding objects do not change.
However, one should not copy a game graph and e.g. use it for another category or version of OoT.
This is highly inadvisable, as different categories can have vastly different prerequisites,
like changed coordinates for different game versions, which would be contained in compound objects.
