# Sub-project for data parsing

This subproject takes a text dump of a OoT ROM as produced by mzxrules' Verbose Ocarina tool (all scene data)
and outputs all actors (room actors, spawn actors and transition actors) as CSV tables.
These tables can then be used as input for the graph builder sub-project.
